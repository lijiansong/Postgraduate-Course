- [ ] ToDo: project integration, add augmented reality module to the project.
- [ ] ToDo: add a module to implement android device control, i.e. one android device end can control another android device end, e.g. send a request to it and etc. the implement mainly hooks into RPC, daemon process and something like server process.
